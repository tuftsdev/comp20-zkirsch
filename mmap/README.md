README file for Comp 20 - Assignment 2 - The Real Marauder's Map
By:  Zach Kirsch
Due: 12 March 2015

1. I believe all expectations of the assignment have been met
   - Site sends user's geolocation to datastore, fetches everyone's locations,
     and displays them all on a map.
2. I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment, though I did do
    research and emulate code from the Google Maps API and stack overflow
    (which is cited in code's comments).
3. I spent about 4 hours on this assignment.

Note: From the last homework, I tried to not commit as much. However, because
      the site cannot be tested locally (because of that limitation of the JS API),
      I had to commit and push with every change that I wanted to check.
