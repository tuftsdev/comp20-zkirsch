This repository holds a number of assignments from Comp 20 that deal with client side and server site web implementations.
My favorite assignment was Assignment 2, the Maurader's Map (/mmap). It was my first experience using API's (Google Maps), sending and receiving HTTP requests to a server, and displaying that data in a fun and user-friendly manner. It was also very interesting to see the interaction of my code with the rest of the class's via the server.
The biggest thing I've learned in this class is how to investigate and solve problems that I don't readily have the answers to. Often in CS classes (and in every department), the solutions are readily available and we just have to figure out how to apply what we've learned. This class went a step beyond, and forced me to not only recognize what the problems were that needed solving, but for me to do my own research in finding out the solution. I think that is a skill that is invaluable and will help me a lot in the future. This was most apparent in the client side interaction with a server (Assignment 2) and the server-side interaction with a Mongo database (Assignment 3).
I am very interested in learning more about applying bigger ideas to web programming (e.g. abstraction, modularity) to create cleaner and more efficient code, which would be necessary for larger-scale sites. I am also interested in learning more about building security features into websites.
Overall, I had a great experience with this course and I learned a tremendous amount. I'm very excited to put what I've learned into building my own sites and to learn more about web programming in the future.
