README file for Comp 20 - Assignment 4 - Security Assessment
By:  Zach Kirsch
Due: 24 April 2015

1. I believe all expectations of the assignment have been met
   - Server was analyzed for security flaws
   - Report was written to document those flaws and possible solutions
2. I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment, though I did take
    some CSS for formatting code blocks from the example on the assignment
    page.
3. I spent about 6 hours on this assignment.

Note: I finished this assignment two days late (4-26) but I forgot to ask for
any tokens. I understand if I lose points on this assignment as a result.
