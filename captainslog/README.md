README file for Comp 20 - Lab 7 - Captain's Log
By:  Zach Kirsch
Due: 31 March 2015

1. I believe all expectations of the assignment have been met
   - User can add logs by filling in the text box and pressing enter
   - Logs are stored in local storage, so that logs are preserved.
2. I worked with Dan Callahan and Danielle Zelin. Also, I referenced
    a stackoverflow page to learn how to listen for the user hitting
    the enter key: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6524288
3. I spent about 30 minutes on this assignment.

Note: there is a security flaw by not santizing the text when adding the user's
message to the HTML.
  i.e. the user could input "</p>[HACKING CODE]<p>" to get access to things
  he/she isn't supposed to.
